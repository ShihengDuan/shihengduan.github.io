<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. My research focuses on the hydroclimate system, exploring climate change impacts, detection and attribution (D&A), and extreme events. I use machine learning and deep learning to study climate, as well as simulations from climate models.

# üìù Publications

- [Higher-order internal modes of variability imprinted in year-to-year California streamflow changes](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-024-01594-2) **Shiheng Duan**, Giuliana Pallotta, C√©line Bonfils
  - Higher-order EOF modes are derived from the well-known climate variability domains. 
  - The BCSD-CMIP6-LSTM streamflow projections are quantitatively related with internal variability indices using various ML models. 
  - All the ML models show PNA-5 is the most dominant pattern affecting streamflow in California, which looks like an atmospheric-river pattern. 
  - BCSD does not change variability indices, as a technical note. 
  - [GitHub](https://github.com/ShihengDuan/ClimateVariabilityStreamflow)

- [Meteorological drivers of North American monsoon extreme precipitation events](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2023JD040535) 
**Shiheng Duan**, Paul Ullrich, William Boos
  - North American Monsoon area is delineated from a gridded precpitation dataset, and further divded into seven subregions with distinct precipitation characteristics. 
  - The meteorological drivers are identified for extreme precpitation events (p95) for each subregion. 
  - The interaction effects of these meteorological drivers on EPE probability are analyzed. 
  - [GitHub](https://github.com/ShihengDuan/NorthAmericanMonsoon)

- [Using temporal deep learning models to estimate daily snow water equivalent over the Rocky Mountains](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2023WR035009)
**Shiheng Duan**, Paul Ullrich, Mark Risser, Alan Rhoades
  - LSTM, TCNN and Transformer models are benchmarked with in-situ snow observations. 
  - A transformation (SWE to SWE ratio) is applied to extrapolate the DL models to generate gridded SWE estimations. 
  - This technique can be used for climate projections (deleted after peer-review). 
  - [GitHub](https://github.com/ShihengDuan/code-SWE)

- [Using convolutional neural networks for streamflow projection in California](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/water/articles/10.3389/frwa.2020.00028/full) **Shiheng Duan**, Paul Ullrich, Lele Shu
  - TCNN can be used for hydrological modelling, in addition to LSTM. 
  - An idealized test is designed for projection purpose. 
  - A "nonlinear" relationship of precipitation-runoff is revealed from DL models for snow-dominant basins. 
  - [GitHub](https://github.com/ShihengDuan/Streamflow)

- [Atmospheric emission inventory of hazardous air pollutants from China's cement plants: Temporal trends, spatial variation characteristics and scenario projections](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231015306385) Hua, Shenbing, et al. 2016
  - A comprehensive emission inventory of air pollutants. 
  - More inventory and air pollution studies from Prof. Tian's team in Beijing Normal University.
