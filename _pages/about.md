I am an Atmospheric Scientist dedicated to bridging the gap between climate research and scalable AI solutions. My research focuses on the hydroclimate system, where I leverage machine learning and deep learning to investigate climate change impacts and advance the detection and attribution (D&A) of extreme events. By integrating physical insights from climate simulations with state-of-the-art AI techniques, I develop robust frameworks for prediction, risk assessment, and adaptation strategies. My work aims to provide actionable intelligence that serves both rigorous academic inquiry and high-stakes industry applications.
